Lao-tzu (604 BC - 531 BC) 

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. 

He who knows does not speak. He who speaks does not know. 

He who knows others is wise; He who know himself is enlightened. 

The more laws and order are made prominent, The more thieves and robbers there will be. 

The softest things in the world overcome the hardest things in the world. Through this I 
know the advantage of taking no action. 

To have little is to possess. To have plenty is to be perplexed.

Confucius (551 BC - 479 BC) 

Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves. 

I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand. 

Ignorance is the night of the mind, but a night without moon and star. 

It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop. 

Men's natures are alike, it is their habits that carry them far apart. 

Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in getting up every time we do. 

Respect yourself and others will respect you. 

To be able under all circumstances to practice five things constitutes perfect virtue; 
these five things are gravity, generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness and kindness. 

Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart. 

They must often change who would be constant in happiness or wisdom. 

The cautious seldom err. 

What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others. 

With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow - I have still 
joy in the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness are to 
me as a floating cloud. 

While you are not able to serve men, how can you serve spirits [of the dead]?...While 

you do not know life, how can you know about death?

Sophocles (496 BC - 406 BC) 

The keenest sorrow is to recognize ourselves as the sole cause of all our adversities. 

Grief teaches the steadiest minds to waver. 

Death is not the worst thing; rather, when one who craves death cannot attain even that wish. 

How dreadful knowledge of the truth can be

When there's no help in truth!

Socrates (469 BC - 399 BC) 

By all means marry; if you get a good wife, you'll be happy. If you get a bad one, you'll 
become a philosopher. 

Do not do to others what angers you if done to you by others. 

Envy is the ulcer of the soul. 

Remember that there is nothing stable in human affairs; therefore avoid undue elation in 
prosperity, or undue depression in adversity. 

I know nothing except the fact of my ignorance.

<div id="div_BCPLATO" style="display: none">
<pre>

Plato (427 BC - 347 BC) 

Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle. 

Desires are only the lack of something: and those who have the greatest desires are in a 
worse condition than those who have none, or very slight ones. 

Man...is a tame or civilized animal; never the less, he requires proper instruction and a 
fortunate nature, and then of all animals he becomes the most divine and most civilized; 
but if he be insufficiently or ill- educated he is the most savage of earthly creatures. 

The price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men. 
There is no such thing as a lover's oath. 

Wise men talk because they have something to say; fools, because they have to say something. 

You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation.

Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC) 

All human actions have one or more of these seven causes: chance, nature, 
compulsion, habit, reason, passion, and desire. 

It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. 

Man perfected by society is the best of all animals; he is the most terrible of all when he 
lives without law, and without justice.

Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 1882) 

A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is braver five minutes longer. 

Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 

Shallow men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect. 

The measure of a master is his success in bringing all men around to his opinion 
twenty years later. 

This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but know what to do with it. 

When you strike at a king, you must kill him. 

The two parties which divide the state, the party of Conservatism and that of Innovation, 
are very old, and have disputed the possession of the world ever since it was made. 

To be great is to be misunderstood. 

Trust men and they will be true to you; treat them greatly, and they will show themselves great. 

When a whole nation is roaring Patriotism at the top of its voice, I am fain to explore the 
cleanness of its hands and purity of its heart. 

The best effect of fine persons is felt after we have left their presence. 

Every artist was first an amateur. 

These times of ours are series and full of calamity, but all times are essentially alike. As 
soon as there is life there is danger. 

It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after 
our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect 
sweetness the independence of solitude.

<div id="div_ADDISR" style="display: none">
<pre>

Benjamin Disraeli (1804 - 1881) 

As a general rule the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information. 

In a progressive country change is constant; ...change... is inevitable. 

The difference of race is one of the reasons why I fear war may always exist; because 
race implies difference, difference implies superiority, and superiority leads to 
predominance. 

The secret of success is constancy of purpose. 

There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. 

We are not creatures of circumstance; we are creators of circumstance. 

When men are pure, laws are useless; when men are corrupt, laws are broken. 

Change is inevitable. In a progressive country change is constant.

Mark Twain (1835 - 1910)

A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it 
back the minute it begins to rain. 

Anyone who stops learning is old, whether twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning 
stays young. The greatest thing you can do is keep your mind young. 

Be careful about reading health books. You may die of a misprint. 

Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society. 

I have spent most of my life worrying about things that have never happened 

If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you. This is the 
principal difference between a dog and a man. 

In his private heart no man respects himself. 

In religion and politics, people's beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten 
at second hand, and without examination. 

It is better to deserve honors and not have them than to have them and not to deserve them. 

It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it 
and remove all doubt. 

It usually takes more than three weeks to prepare a good impromptu speech. 

Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, 
but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great. 

Let us be thankful for the fools. But for them the rest of us could not succeed. 

The right word may be effective, but no word was ever as effective as a rightly timed pause. 

Whenever you find that you are on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect. 

Of all the animals, man is the only one that is cruel. He is the only one that inflicts pain 
for the pleasure of doing it. 

It is by the goodness of God that in our country we have those three unspeakably 
precious things: freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and the prudence never to 
practice either of them. 

Man is the Only Animal that Blushes. Or needs to. 

All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence; then success is sure. 

Sane and intelligent human beings are like all other human beings, and carefully and 
cautiously and diligently conceal their private real opinions from the world and give out 
fictitious ones in their stead for general consumption. 

Of all God's creatures there is only one that cannot be made the slave of the lash. 
That one is the cat. 

How little a thing can make us happy when we feel that we have earned it. 

Laws are sand, customs are rock. Laws can be evaded and punishment escaped but an 
openly transgressed custom brings sure punishment.

Ambrose Bierce (1842 - 1914) 

Acquaintance, n.: A person whom we know well enough to borrow from, but not well 
enough to lend to. 

Brain: an apparatus with which we think we think. 

Cogito cogito ergo cogito sum (I think that I think, therefore I think that I am.) 

Politeness, n. The most acceptable hypocrisy. 

Quotation, n: The act of repeating erroneously the words of another. 

The gambling known as business looks with austere disfavor upon the business known as gambling.

Mahatma Gandhi (1869 - 1948)

Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes. 

Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. 

I believe in equality for everyone, except reporters and photographers. 

I cannot teach you violence, as I do not myself believe in it. I can only teach you not to 
bow your heads before any one even at the cost of your life. 

Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will. 

The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong. 

Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it. 

You must be the change you want to see in the world. 

You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean 
are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.

W. Somerset Maugham (1874 - 1965) 
 
The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain, egotistic, and self-
complacent is erroneous; on the contrary, it makes them, for the most part, humble, 
tolerant, and kind. Failure makes people cruel and bitter. 

There are three rules for writing the novel. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are. 

Art is merely the refuge which the ingenious have invented, when they were supplied 
with food and women, to escape the tediousness of life. 

Money is like a sixth sense without which you cannot make a complete use of the other five. 

There's always one who loves and one who lets himself be loved. 

The most useful thing about a principle is that it can always be sacrificed to expediency. 

A God that can be understood is no God. Who can explain the Infinite in words? 

A mother only does her children harm if she makes them the only concern of her life. 

Often the best way to overcome desire is to satisfy it. 

Perhaps the most important use of money - It saves time. Life is so short, and there's so 
much to do, one can't afford to waste a minute; and just think how much you waste, for 
instance, in walking from place to place instead of going by bus and in going by bus 
instead of by taxi.

Sir Winston Churchill (1874 - 1965) 

I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals. 

It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others 
that have been tried. 

It's not enough that we do our best; sometimes we have to do what's required. 

One ought never to turn one's back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it. If 
you do that, you will double the danger. But if you meet it promptly and without 
flinching, you will reduce the danger by half. 

Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm. 

The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue 
of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries. 

The price of greatness is responsibility. 

When the eagles are silent, the parrots begin to jabber. 

Where there is a great deal of free speech there is always a certain amount of foolish speech. 

Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak, Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.

Never give in--never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never 
give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never 
yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.
